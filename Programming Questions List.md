This repository contains various programming solutions in the C programming language .... Below are various C programs and the solutions of them can be find in my GitHub account...please search for the solutions by maintaining the question number.
1. Write a C program to find out all the UGLY NUMBERS between 1 and 100. An ugly number is a special type of number whose only prime factors are 2, 3 and 5. Make the use of user-defined functions as and when necessarry.
2.	Write a C program to find out the sum of the following series:

      S = 1!/1 + 2!/2 + 3!/3 + 4!/4 + â€¦ + n!/n 

      Using an User-defined function, you have to do it.
   
3. Write a program in C to count the number of all duplicate elements in a one-dimensional array.
4. Write a C program to check whether a given number is ABUNDANT or not. An abundant number is a special type of number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Make use of user-defined functions as and when necessary.
5. Write a C program to calculate the root of a quadratic equation. Take the values of the constants from the user. At first display the whole equation and then display the root of that equation. Make use of user-defined function as and when necessary. 
6. Write a C program to check whether a given integer (to be taken from the user) is a PALINDROME or not. Make use of user-defined function as and when necessary.
7. Write a C program to find out the sum of contiguous sub-array within a 1-D array of numbers which has the largest sum. 
8. Write a C program to find out power of any number xy without using any built-in functions.
9. Write a program in C to calculate and print the ELECTRICITY BILL of a given customer. The cust_id, name, and unit consumed by the user should be taken from the keyboard and display the total amount to be paid by the customer. 
      The charges are as follows: 

      UNIT	CHARGE PER UNIT.

      Up to 199	@1.20

      200 and above but less than 400	@1.50

      400 and above but less than 600	@1.80

      600 and above	@2.00

      If bill exceeds Rs. 400/- then a surcharge of 15% will be charged and the minimum bill should be of Rs. 100/-.
  10. Write a program to find unique elements in an array
